# Our development roadmap is designed to ensure that we stay on track with our goals:

1. **Conceptualization & Research (Month 1-2):** During this phase, we will define the project's scope, identify potential users, and begin researching the tools we will include in AIOS-SR.
2. **Development (Month 3-6):** This phase will involve creating a prototype of AIOS-SR. We will create a bootable Linux environment, integrate the chosen tools, and develop a user-friendly interface.
3. **Testing (Month 7-8):** During this phase, we will thoroughly test AIOS-SR to ensure it works as intended on a variety of systems. We will fix any bugs that arise and make necessary adjustments based on the results of our tests.
4. **Launch (Month 9):** After testing, we will launch AIOS-SR to the public. We will make it freely available for download and provide comprehensive documentation on how to use it.
5. **Feedback & Iteration (Month 10-12):** After launch, we will collect user feedback and use this to guide our updates and improvements to AIOS-SR.
6. **Ongoing Maintenance (Month 13 onwards):** We will continue to maintain and update AIOS-SR, ensuring that it remains a relevant and effective tool for system recovery and diagnostics.

## Remember, our timeline is an estimate and may change based on a variety of factors. We are committed to keeping our users informed about any significant changes or updates.
