## Why

A handy question to always be asking! As stated in our roadmap there’s a challenge to bring tools to one place. This product wouldn’t be possible without these tools. We are not programmers we have not wrote any of the major tools, we might create our own scripts which do certain sub tasks and Cron jobs for our menu but really we’re just making use of someone’s hard work over the years. 

This page contains a list of reference tools and materials. 

*********************All work and tools and creators will be referenced in the Wiki and direct links to their manuals will be present.********************* 

## UBCD

### Link

[https://www.ultimatebootcd.com/](https://www.ultimatebootcd.com/)

### About

The UBCD is the flagship product in my opinion for IT tools when diagnosing a computers hardware. 

### Likely Risks

This is a BSD toolkit therefore some of the tools might need to be taken from the product where they contain a Debian counter part. (Most should) 

### Main Considered Tools

- [ ]  Darek’s Boot and Nuke (DBAN)
- [ ]  Memtest86+ (Memory Test)
- [x]  Photorec (Photo Recovery)
- [x]  Testdisk (Partition Recovery)
- [ ]  ATA Diagnostic Tool (Hard Disk, Works with most)

## Graphic GPU testing

Not sure on this one as one is used to using such tools as the FurMark tool. 

If we do construct this tool into a GUI this tool can be considered, however some research should be made to look for a cli based tool if one exists. 

GLMARK2 is the so far chosen product for this.
